# Delivery Routing System - An exploration of Data Structures & Algorithms

Through the use of Python, this console application helps to solve a variant of the "traveling saleman problem". Given a
detailed list of package information, two drivers needed a quick route to make the expected deliveries in under 140 total miles traveled.
A host of issues needed to be handled including wrong addresses, specific instructions, and delivery deadlines.

A hash map was utilized to help organize packages and allow quick access. A supervisor can use the console to get a overview of the route taken
and find when packages were delivered, what there status was at a particular time, and the milage of the trucks either individually or combined.
